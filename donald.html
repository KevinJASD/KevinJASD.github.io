<p>The news of Donald Glover retiring Childish Gambino is heartbreaking to early fans and new fans who fell in love with <it>'Awaken My Love'.</it> With the release of the album, Donald Glover has reached significant mainstream success as an artist. Along with his music career, his writing and acting career exploded with the premiere of 'Atlanta' and landing the role of Lando in the new Star Wars film. Donald Glover is in full swing of his renaissance pinnacle (which we hope will never stop). And although Childish Gambino wont be around anymore Donald Glover sure will be. It's the distinction between Gambino and Glover has never been more clear and has never been more important to remember.</p>
