We know Vince can handle electronic instrumentals <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRU2cgjf5LM"> (Vince-Fire In The Booth) </a>, but this was a radical shift to heavy bass electronic production. It's unconventional for sure, but with artists dropping surprise albums, Gambino having an entire album without a single rap verse, and Tyler the Creator having an album where he is not agressively obscene who cares. This album may mark the beginning of something (it'd be suffocating to classify what it is yet). Obviously, Vince likes the sound of electronic instrumentals and maybe this album was an experiment for him to develop a flow that is electronic, but doesn't drown out his already paradoxically laid-back and agressive style. The significance of the album is that he never sacrificed that style to fit the nature of an electronic beats. This is why on some songs his flow and the beat are out of sync and don't want to coexist in the same space. Rather, it seems he is more trying to tame the beast and make it fit his style which could form something completely new. This is one we'll just have to wait for.</p>
