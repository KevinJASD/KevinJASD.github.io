<p> Childish Gambino's retirement <span class="disappear">The news of Donald Glover retiring Childish Gambino</span> is heartbreaking for fans (both from <it>'Sick Boi'</it> fans and <it>'Awaken My Love'</it>) and the branch unconventional hip-hop. With the release of the <it>'Awaken My Love'</it>, Donald Glover has reached significant mainstream success as an artist. Along with his music career, his writing and acting careers exploded with the premiere of 'Atlanta' and landing the role of Lando in the new Star Wars film. Donald Glover is in full swing of his renaissance pinnacle (which we hope will never stop). And although Childish Gambino wont be around anymore Donald Glover sure will be. It's the distinction between Gambino and Glover has never been more clear.</p>

<p>Donald Glover is a ever-evolving person and Childish Gambino is an embodiment. As an embodiment Gambino belongs to a certain time. The social context of that time, and temporal struggles and challenges for Glover at that time are all topics which he uses in his music (Awaken My Love was about the birth of his child). This is an inextricable truth of Gambino's existence means when the time for the things which he embodies comes to an end so does he. Some lyrics dealth with timesless topics such as <span class-"disappear">What's a leader if he isn't relucant?" or </span> "the world saying who you are because you're young and black". Race will always be, for the forseeable future, relavent to any particular person and such a person will be able to understand that lyric just as someone did in 2011 or even now. But, timeless topics such as race can't support a never-ending career.  For Gambino those ideas had their time and therefore came to an end. Donald Glover on the other hand, is continually evolving in different artforms and rebirthing ideas of race in 'Atlanta'. <p>

<p>However, the fact is his music <it>did</it> have a timeless quality to it. His unique and textured approach introduced a new perspective to being black in America or finding success sooner rather than later. These ideas wont die, regardless of whether Gambino is putting out singles. Equally, the complexity of timeless topics means that listeners may discover another meaning or understanding to the music he has put out years later. Really, we should just be grateful we had him for the time we did.</p>
